**Abstract**

Virulent fungal plant pathogens are a serious threat to crop productivity and are considered a major limitation to food security worldwide. To meet these challenges, pathogen detection is crucial for taking appropriate measures to curb yield losses. Disease diagnosis at an early stage is one of the best strategies for crop protection. Earlier, traditional methods were used to diagnose and manage the fungal diseases, which included visual scouting of the disease symptoms and spray of fungicides. The utility of immunoassays for early detection and precise identity has been appreciably stepped forward following the improvement of enzyme-connected immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and monoclonal antibodies. Nucleic acid-based diagnostic techniques have turn out to be the preferred type, because of their greater speed, specificity, sensitivity, reliability, and reproducibility. The biosensor eliminates the need of sample preparation and can be used for on-site detection of fungal pathogens at latent infection stages so that preventive measures can be taken. Currently, multiple human and animal diseases have been detected with the help of biosensors. However, reports on plant pathogen detection using biosensors are still in its infancy. Despite the many applications of antibodies, there are also multiple drawbacks, including high cost, low physical and chemical stability, and the ethical issues associated with their use. Now, DNA based biosensors are gaining popularity because of their sensitive and precise detection of DNA target sequences. Immunological and DNA based techniques combined with nanotechnology offer highly sensitive and selective gel-free detection methods, and the lab-on-chip (LOC) feature of biosensors make them a very reliable tool in crop protection.

**Abstract**

Nutritional stress is affecting over two billion people worldwide. As the Mmajority of cereals we consume in our daily routine are deficient in micronutrients. To overcome this, researchers should emphasize grain quality improvement of cereals. Identification of genomic regions/ quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for and their successful introgression in elite cultivars through marker-assisted breeding (MAB) has been widely used by researchers to develop nutrient-rich varieties. Further, the advent of genome editing (GE) has revolutionized crop improvement. Unprecedented opportunities are offered by GE for specific and speedy improvement of crop plants. GE has also been used in cereals for improvement of various quality traits, however, recently the focus has been towards grain quality improvement. GE has been utilized to create specific mutations in the target gene or regulatory region to generate allelic variations which can be utilized for nutrient quality improvement. This chapter deals with various advancements made in cereal grain quality improvement using the identified QTLs and GE to attain nutrient security. In addition, it also highlights the merits and demerits of the different GE tools and the regulatory issues associated with the commercialization of genome-edited crop plants.

**Abstract**

CRISPR/Cas mediated editing has revolutionized the way we engineer plant genomes. Many studies have been carried out in the past few years towards optimization of the genome editing constructs. The choice of promoters used to drive gRNA and cas9 expression is critical to achieve high editing efficiency. We have collated the information about different types of promoters used for genome editing in plants and their impact on editing efficiency. While some of the important considerations while opting for a particular promoter depend on 1) Nature of the gene targeted, 2) Host organism, 3) Single or multiplex editing, 4) Size of construct, 5) Mode of transformation, and 6) Expected impact of editing on plant morphology and survival; the key benefits and limitations associated with different types of promoters used for engineering plant genomes have been elaborated.
